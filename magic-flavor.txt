He wields the full power of wrath unfettered by the sympathies of a soul
He will be your loyal champion and his pack your protectors All he asks for is a full belly a spot by the fire and all the love in your heart
He will carve out a legend for himself with his own two hands
He will win who prepared himself waits to take the enemy unprepared Sun Tzu Art of War trans Giles

He wished for knowledge but not for the will to apply it
He wished for power but not for the longevity to abuse it

Shes always willing to lend a hand It just wont be her own
Shes an inspiration to everyone even herself
Shes brilliant if a bit overbearing
She seeks the warmth of the living
She sees beyond technology to what it enables Glacian powerstone engineer
She sees mortals not as they wish to be but as what they will become
She shepherds mysteries and dust as others would a flock of sheep
She showed up to class on a what Valentin Witherbloom Dean
She sings for all those who have been silenced
She sold her soul to four demons for powerful gifts
She speaks only in vile epithets spitting out curses and obscenities that harm others just by the hearing
She speaks only in whispers but can be heard over the fiercest storm
She speaks with the voice of the winds and the earth trembles
She spent many years trying to harness chaos
She spins a web few can resist Its sweet aroma sparks chaos in every heart
She spoke of mystery and portent of such unfathomable things that my mind screamed for pity The Seers Parables
She stands as a living symbol of the natural world and an enemy of the forces that threaten it
She stands ready always watchful knowing that weeks of peace and serenity can be overturned by a single distant sail
She sticks to her chosen master closer than their own shadow
She stretches the laws of physics until they snap
She swings with the ease of flowing lava and hits with the force of a meteor
She talks using riddles her disciples alone can unravel
She trusts that the potent poisons of her darts will reach the enemy before the enemy reaches her
She turns ash into flame and burns enemies to ash
She walks among us unseen learning from our imperfections The Seers Parables
She walks in the twilight her steps make no sound Her feet leave no tracks on the dewcovered ground Her hand gently beckons she whispers your name But those who go with her are never the same
She wanted to inspire terror wherever she went The demons happily granted her wish
She was a ragged shadow of her living form but she had lost none of her deadly prowess
She was born unable to walk Through the eludha she was able to fly
She was ghastly chalkily pale the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums and the bones of her face stood out prominently her breathing was painful to see or hear
She was winning the Dominarian Are You Hot competition until disaster struck during the wet Tshirt round
She watches over the city just as Serra watches over all
She watches the chaos created by the Roil seeking strength in the patterns of anarchy
She wears the talismans of every creature she can evoke
She weaves an elaborate spell of love care and protection enveloping her people in soothing warmth
She wept not from perfect understanding but from serene gratitude
She whispered a prayer for strength and her wishes wafted away like seeds on the wind
She who once led prayers honoring the kami adapted to use her influence to stay them
She wields a blade as bloodthirsty and elegant as herself
She will come back to me
She will not be content until hers is the highest head in the sky
She will not touch a weapon yet she is the greatest protector her people have ever known
She wished for a weapon but not for the skill to wield it
She wished for gold but not for the strength to carry it
She wished for nobility but not for a nation to honor it
She wont rest until shes collected specimens of every bird on Innistrad
She yearned to walk on dry land so she might take her vengeance there
